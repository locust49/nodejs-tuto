# Send request
backend is not only about nodeJS, we actually need a (./VID#03/server.js)
so.. run it run it run it run it ... infinitely ? nop.
# Receive response
We've only made a request "localhost:3k" without receiving a response.
Check the (./VID#04/server.js)
# Basic routing
it's aint fun if we always get the same page whatever the url is right ?
===> (./VID#04/server.js) again..
